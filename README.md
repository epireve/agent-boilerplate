# AI Agent Boilerplate 🤖

A collection of scaffolding templates and guidelines for popular AI agent frameworks. This repository aims to provide a structured starting point for building AI agent-based applications. Right now, the scaffold works with cursorrules (Read more about cursorrules [here](https://medium.com/@ashinno43/what-are-cursor-rules-and-how-to-use-them-ec558468d139)).

## 🎯 Motivation

Building AI agents can be complex, with different frameworks offering various approaches and architectures. This repository was inspired by VRSEN's [Agency Swarm](https://vrsen.github.io/agency-swarm). This serves as a centralized resource for:

- Standardized project structures for different AI agent frameworks
- Best practices and guidelines for each framework
- Quick-start templates to accelerate development
- Framework-specific configuration and setup instructions

## 🚀 Supported Frameworks

Currently, this repository includes templates for:

### [Agency Swarm](https://vrsen.github.io/agency-swarm)
- Multi-agent collaborative framework
- Focused on creating agencies of specialized AI agents
- Includes tool integration and agent communication patterns

### [Crew AI](https://docs.crewai.com)
- Role-based autonomous AI agents
- YAML-based configuration for agents and tasks
- Structured workflow orchestration
